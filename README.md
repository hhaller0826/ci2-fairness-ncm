# ci2-fairness-ncm
The IntroFairnessNCM.ipynb notebook in this repository is designed to facilitate causal fairness analysis through the use of Neural Causal Models. 

Target users are researchers outside the field of causal inference, and students of causal inference, particularly those working out of the [Causal Artificial Intelligence](https://causalai-book.net/) textbook.
