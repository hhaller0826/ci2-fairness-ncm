Each node on the graph may represent one or more of these features, though the name of the node does *not* need to correspond to the data column that it will represent. Please note that if a single node represents multiple features, we will not be able to distinguish between these features when doing causal analysis. \n",

If C is one of the nodes on your graph, then there will be one directed edge from C to A, and another from C to B. If C is *not* one of the nodes on your graph, then we will create a bi-directed edge between A and B to signify that they are confounded. "

The default processing functions will handle converting categorical data and other standard tasks, but if, for example, you want one of the features to be converted into binary value, you will have to do that here.\n",
