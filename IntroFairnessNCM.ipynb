Each node on the graph may represent one or more of these features, though the name of the node does *not* need to correspond to the data column that it will represent. Please note that if a single node represents multiple features, we will not be able to distinguish between these features when doing causal analysis. \n",

If C is one of the nodes on your graph, then there will be one directed edge from C to A, and another from C to B. If C is *not* one of the nodes on your graph, then we will create a bi-directed edge between A and B to signify that they are confounded. "
